**Error Path Diagram:**  
Not applicable — no error handling or async error propagation found.

**CORS/Network Validation:**  
Not applicable — no network/fetch code found.

**Timing Analysis:**  
Timing evidence unavailable from static source excerpts; no async or network code present.

**Issue Identified:**  
None found in the provided files.

**Validation:**  
Runtime timing validation is unavailable from this request; only static type exports and re-exports are present. No async logic to test in these excerpts.

#### Partition 3 of 7

**Async Flow Analysis**

Patterns Present:  
- Promise chains (explicit `new Promise`)
- async/await (in tests)
- No `.then()` or `.catch()` methods found
- No `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, or HTTP client calls (no CORS/network code)

---

**Execution Chain:**

*From `src/application/use-cases/GetCurrentPositionUseCase.ts`:*
```
1. [Start] execute(options?) called
2. [Promise created] wrapping provider.getCurrentPosition
3. [provider.getCurrentPosition calls success or error callback]
   - If success: resolve({ position: pos }) - SUCCESS
   - If error: reject(error) - FAILED
```

*From `src/application/use-cases/GetCurrentPositionUseCase.test.ts`:*
- Tests use `await useCase.execute()` and `await expect(useCase.execute()).rejects.toEqual(...)`
- No additional async chains beyond the Promise in the use case.

---

**Error Path Diagram:**
```
[provider.getCurrentPosition]
    ↓
[Success?]
    ↓
┌───┴───┐
↓       ↓
[Yes]   [No]
↓       ↓
[resolve]  [reject] → [Promise rejected, test expects error]
```

---

**CORS/Network Validation:**  
Not applicable — no fetch/HTTP/network code found.

---

**Timing Analysis:**  
- No explicit runtime traces, logs, or timestamps present.
- No parallel async operations or Promise.all usage.
- No timeout handling in the Promise itself (relies on provider).
- Timing evidence unavailable from static source excerpts.

---

**Issue Identified:**  
None found in the provided excerpts. The async-to-callback bridge is implemented correctly, and error propagation is covered by tests.

---

**Validation:**  
Runtime timing validation is unavailable from this request; async behavior is tested via unit tests using async/await and Promise rejection assertions.

#### Partition 4 of 7

**Async Flow Analysis**

Patterns Present: none

- No `async function`, `await`, `.then()`, `.catch()`, or `Promise` usage found in the provided files.
- No `fetch`, `XMLHttpRequest`, or HTTP client calls (no CORS/network scope).
- All async-like flows are callback-based (e.g., `watchPosition`, `clearWatch`), but not wrapped in Promises or using async/await.

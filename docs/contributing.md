## Adding a New Provider

1. Create `src/infrastructure/providers/<Name>Provider.ts`.
2. Extend `GeolocationProvider` from `src/domain/ports/GeolocationProvider`.
3. Implement `getCurrentPosition`, `watchPosition`, `clearWatch`, and `isSupported`.
4. Re-export from `src/infrastructure/providers/index.ts` and `src/infrastructure/index.ts`.
5. Add corresponding tests in `test/infrastructure/providers/<Name>Provider.test.ts`.
6. Prefer `MockGeolocationProvider` in higher-level tests when you need deterministic positions, delayed callbacks, or manual watch updates without a browser runtime.
7. For HTTP-backed adapters such as `AwsGeocoder`, keep network concerns in the infrastructure layer and document any required environment variables or constructor configuration in `README.md` and `docs/getting-started.md`.

## Coding Standards

- **TypeScript strict mode** is enforced (`"strict": true` in `tsconfig.json`).
- All public APIs must have JSDoc comments.
- Keep layers pure: domain must not import from application or infrastructure; application must not import from infrastructure.
- Test coverage is expected for all new code. Run `npm run test:coverage` to check.

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Tests pass (`npm test`)
- [ ] New code has unit tests
- [ ] Docs updated if public API changed (`npm run docs`)
- [ ] No cross-layer imports violating the dependency rule
- [ ] Commit messages are descriptive and follow conventional format
